Hello, I'm a behavioural scientist at [Warwick Business School](https://www.wbs.ac.uk) in the [University of Warwick](https://www.warwick.ac.uk/).

Welcome to my personal web page. You might also enjoy my [official web page](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/neil-stewart).

I work in the field of behavioural and economic science, and apply this research to problems in the real world. Right now I am working on consumer decision making using mass transaction data, on criminal and other bad behaviour using crime and incident records, and on a mathematical models of cognition. I use a mixture of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and econometric and data science techniques applied to large data sets.
