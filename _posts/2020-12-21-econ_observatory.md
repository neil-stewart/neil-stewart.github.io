[John Gathergood](https://sites.google.com/site/gathergoodjohn/) and I received a UKRI COVID-19 Rapid Response grant for a project on "Real-time evaluation of the effects of Covid-19 and policy responses on consumer and small business finances". 

You can read some of our early insights at the Economics Observatory:
