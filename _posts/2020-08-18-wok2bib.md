A lot of people have been asking me how I keep this blog so edgy. Like this:

wok2bib is a command line utility for converting Web of Knowledge or Web of Science saved records into bibtex references for use with latex. wok2apa converts records to plain text APA format.

You can find them on [github](https://github.com/neil-stewart/wok2bib_and_wok2apa). 

Here is an example of wok2bib at work:
