<p>This website is build using Jekyll and the minima theme. I followed the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Jekyll step-by-step tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/publications.html">publications</a> page is made using <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll scholar</a>, which builds the whole page—links and all—from my master bibtex file.</p>

<p>Because I have used the Jekyll scholar extension, which is not available on GitHub Pages, I have to build the site locally, pushing it to git as described in <a href="http://sarahcassady.com/2015/07/17/jekyll-on-github-pages/">Jekyll on Github Pages with Plugins</a> tutorial.</p>
